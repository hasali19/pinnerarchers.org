Shooting takes place on Monday evenings indoors from 7.30pm at Tithe Farm Sports & Social Club, where the indoor range allows for shooting at 20yds. When the hall is not available on Mondays, the shooting night may be moved to Thursdays.

Outdoor shooting takes place on Sunday afternoons, typically 2pm to 4pm from May until September (& once a month from October until April 1pm to 3pm) at our shooting grounds at Metropolitan Bushey Sports Ground, Aldenhan Rd, Bushey. The outdoor range allows shooting distances of up to 70m.

We have a healthy membership, with new members joining each year after successfully completing a Beginners Course. Pinner Archers have two experienced coaches and run a 5 session Beginners Course course starting in June.

The club supports both recurve and longbow disciplines. Unfortunately we are not currently able to accommodate compound archers.
